          <h2><strong>THE TRIFECTA: FINANCIAL SECURITY, FAMILY, AND HELPING PEOPLE</strong></h2>
          <p>I went to law school with a dream of having financial security, time with my family, and the ability to positively impact people’s lives. For the last 19 years as an attorney, I have never had all three at the same time.  Time with my family meant financial sacrifice.  Financial success was always at the expense of my family.  At the end of the day as an attorney, with some notable (yet rare exceptions) I rarely feel like I have helped people.  I have discovered a better way!</p>

          <h1><strong>OPTIMAL HEALTH</strong></h1>
          <p>While Western medicine definitely has its place in the treatment of disease, I think there is almost always a better way.  I am passionate about finding natural solutions to health concerns.  It is not enough to be free of disease – I want people to experience optimal health.</p>

          <h2><strong>WHAT I CAN OFFER</strong></h2>
          <h1><strong>A BETTER WAY</strong></h1>
          <p>I have been employed in the public and private sector.  As an employee, I had to work the hours and on the cases dictated by a boss.  I also owned my own firm which meant I was responsible for overhead, employees, and everything related to a small business.  I have discovered an industry that allows everyone to own their life!  The start-up cost is minimal and the income potential is unlimited.</p>
