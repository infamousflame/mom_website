              <p>I went to law school with a dream of having financial security, time with my family, and the ability to positively impact peopleâ€™s lives. For the last 19 years as an attorney, I have never had all three at the same time.  Time with my family meant financial sacrifice.  Financial success was always at the expense of my family.  At the end of the day as an attorney, with some notable (yet rare exceptions) I rarely feel like I have helped people.  I have discovered a better way!</p>
